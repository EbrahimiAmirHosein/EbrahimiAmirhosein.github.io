| ![](/images/motion.png) [** Motion-discriminator **](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Motion-discriminator) <br>Theoretical implications for cognitive and neural models of simple decision-making to check whether people move rapidly toward the optimal policy or not.. | ![](/images/vuln.png) [**Vulnerability-Detection using machine learning approaches**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Vulnerability-Detection) <br> Detecting Vulnerabilities in cyber security by utilizing machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate potential weaknesses in digital systems.  | ![](/images/job.png) [**Stereotypical Job beliefs**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Stereotypical-beliefs-about-jobs) <br>In this assignment, a list of jobs will be shown randomly to the individual and the subject will be asked to specify the degree of masculinity or femininity of each job on a continuum using mouse movement.|
| ![](/images/gaze.png) [**TempoGaze**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/TempoGaze) <br>In this project, we seek to estimate the duration and location of the gaze. We propose an interdisciplinary model by taking advantage of deep learning and decision-making models. | ![](/images/accelerator.png) [**Bio-SFA-bio-NICA-accelerator**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Bio-SFA-bio-NICA-accelerator) <br> Proposing an accelerator for two bio-inspired algorithms. | ![](/images/ResNet.png) [**Parameter estimation using residual neural network**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Parameter-estimation-using-residual-neural-network) <br>In this work, we represent a practical approach capable of estimating any stochastic process, whether its likelihood function comes from an unknown distribution or the model relies on simulation-based approaches for data generation. |
| ![](/images/graphs.png) [**a new approach for minimum dominating set in graphs**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Distributed-algorithms-for-minimum-dominating-set) <br> New approach for minimum dominating set (MDS) problem and minimum total dominating set (MTDS) problem. | ![](/images/Temp.png) [**Temporal Bisection**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Temporal-Bisection) <br>measuring the duration of stimuli, storing duration information in memory, recalling such memories, and comparing two durations. | ![](/images/winsc.png) [**Wisconsin Task**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Wisconsin-Card-Sorting-Test) <br>WCST is a neuropsychological test used to measure such higher-level cognitive processes as attention, perseverance, WM, abstract thinking, CF, and set-shifting. |
| ![](/images/svd.png) [**Singular value decomposition**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Singular-value-decomposition) <br>Implementing SVD algotihm in C. | ![](/images/sig.png)[**Signal Generator- ARM stm32**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Signal-Generator-ARM-stm32) <br>Designing a signal generator. | ![](/images/timer.png)[**8086 Timer**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/8086-Timer-In-Proteus) <br> Designing a timer in 8086. |
| ![](/images/pong.png) [**PONG Game**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/PONG-Game-in-8086-assembly) <br>single version of pong game in 8086 assembly using emu8086 framework. | ![](/images/nn.png) [**Comment verification using nueral networks**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/comment_verification) <br>Verifying the Digikala's comments | ![](/images/cancer.png) [**Feature Selection and Cancer Detection**](https://github.com/EbrahimiAmirHosein/Feature-Selection-and-Cancer-Detection/tree/main) <br>leveraging feature selection techniques to extract the most relevant features and then applying machine learning models to detect cancer.|
