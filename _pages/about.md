<p class="intro">
Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Amirhossein Ebrahimi</span>, a Master's student in Biomedical Engineering, with a deep passion for <span class="highlight">Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</span>.
</p>

I earned my Bachelor's degree from **Shahid Beheshti University**, and now, I'm thrilled to embark on my next academic chapter at the **University of Ottawa**. Under the mentorship of [Professor Arvind Mer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xy6KKl8AAAAJ&hl=en), I am diving into cutting-edge research at the intersection of **AI and healthcare**, aiming to drive meaningful **social impact**.

###  Research Interests
I am particularly fascinated by the transformative power of AI in medical applications, with a keen focus on:

<ul class="twocol" markdown='1'>
  <li> <b>Graph Neural Networks</b></li>
  <li> <b>Computer Vision</b></li>
  <li> <b>Computational Pathology</b></li>
  <li> <b>Bioinformatics</b></li>
  <li> <b>Machine Learning</b></li>
</ul>

 My goal? To **push the boundaries of AI-driven innovation** in healthcare, bridging the gap between technology and human well-being.
